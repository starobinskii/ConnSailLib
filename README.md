# ConnSailLib
This is a single-header C++ Library from Ailurus Studio that we are using to create Unmanned Surface Vehicles. 

Inspired by [Chris Veness](https://github.com/chrisveness/).

## Integration

[`conn.hh`](https://github.com/starobinskii/ConnSailLib/blob/master/conn.hh) is the single header. Install it with simple `make install` from a [release](https://github.com/starobinskii/ConnSailLib/releases). You need to add

```cpp
#include <conn>
```

to your source file to use this library.
